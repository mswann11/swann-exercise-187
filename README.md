This program allows the user to order items and calculates their grand total. First, the user will create an account or login with a user name and password. They can then load inventory by entering the name of a text file with items. The user can then create an order by choosing an item ID to search the file for. They will then choose a quantity and a discount option. The program will then display a summary detailing the chosen item, subtotal, tax, and order total, along with the discount, discount amount, and discount price, if applicable. It will also display a random prize that the user will receive. The program will keep track of the inventory of each item, and inventories can be reloaded. When the user is finished, the program will load the items the user has chosen to purchase into a new file, and display a summary showing each item along with the grand total.
